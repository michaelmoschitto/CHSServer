Questions:

    When is sql run? Why is it wrong?

    1: in logout deleting only this.id not what query param is. can only log yourself out.
    2: go to add in id, not failing previous tests becuase logging out when should't


    Running into problem not finding sessions w/ Req. Its the reason that logout Admin
    is failing at the botom of SSn Modification. I think it is supposed to do with cookies.
    Should I never delete cookies? This seems like a hack and wrong.

    Q: Why does second Logout all work but not first?
    A: Forget why but this was fixed.

    Q: Should I be handling 404's individually in ssn DEL
    
    Q: Is DEL Ssn/id correct?

    Q: Is going through tests a valid way to do it?
    A: Yes, might also want to highlight

    Q: WTF is the check general login for! 404 comes before 401! 

    Q: If 500's the server crashes in cnn pool bc no res, is this closure or an error?
    A: This may be bc 

Notes:

    * Reason seems like logins aren't preserved: every time restart server clears memory. 
    
    * NEED TO RELEASE CNN EACH TIME. Couldn't figure out for the longest time why things seemed to 
        "hang". Each req comes with cnn, MUST BE released even if not doing db connection.


CheckBox For Functions:
    1) end request
    2) call cb manually in last waterfall
    3) always release connection
    5) make sure there are parens after if(chain.chain.check())
    4) review spec one more time
