1) Need help debugging why 2 Cnvs get added if newCnv made when 
there are no others. Not 2 in DB, ,but somehow the redux store gets updated twice
2) C
3) 



Notes:
    if index.js:1 Warning: Cannot update a component (`CnvOverView`) 
    while rendering a different component (`ConfDialog`). 
    To locate the bad setState() call inside `ConfDialog`, 
    follow the stack trace as described in

    NEED A CLOSURE


Likes Fiasco:
    Currently the messages page doesn't get updated until the button is pressed.
    Before likes got update on each mouseover, but then on click they also get u
    updated since each click is a mouseover. 
    If I updated them each time in the useEffect huge rendering issue


Components that need to be converted
    * CnvModal
